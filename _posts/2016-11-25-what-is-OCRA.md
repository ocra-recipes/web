O.C.R.A. stands for **Optimization-based Control for Robotics Applications**. It is a set of tools which facilitates the development of optimization-based controllers for robots. At its core there is ocra-recipes, a group of platform independent libraries which can be used to quickly develop optimization-based controllers for any robot. Hierarchical, weighted, and hybrid controller schemes can easily be implemented using the ocra-recipes libraries. The generic interfaces provided by O.C.R.A. allow different robots to use the exact same controllers. Examples of such implementations can be found for the humanoid robot iCub (ocra-wbi-plugins), and the 7 DoF Kuka LWR (ocra-kdl). O.C.R.A. also allows users to specify high-level objectives via tasks. These tasks provide an intuitive way of generating complex behaviors and can be specified in XML format.
