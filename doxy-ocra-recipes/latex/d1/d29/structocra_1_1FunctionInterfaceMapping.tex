\subsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$class Derived$>$\\*
struct ocra\+::\+Function\+Interface\+Mapping$<$ Derived $>$}

This structure is meant to be use jointly with the \hyperlink{classocra_1_1Constraint}{Constraint} class through a C\+R\+TP mechanism to access the protected members of \hyperlink{classocra_1_1Constraint}{Constraint} or \hyperlink{classocra_1_1Objective}{Objective} and replicate their interfaces. The generic structure is completly empty so as to induce no memory cost when used as a base class in the common case. It must be specialized for values of the template parameter Derived.
