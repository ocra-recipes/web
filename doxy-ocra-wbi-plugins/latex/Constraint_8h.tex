\-In order to use this class instantiate an object of type \hyperlink{classMIQPLinearConstraints}{\-M\-I\-Q\-P\-Linear\-Constraints} passing to it the period of execution of the containing thread (in ms) and the length of the preview window. \-At 'construction' time, shape and admissibility matrices will be built while the \-R\-H\-S of the total inequality constraints will be only allocated, waiting for an update by the user with the current and a history of states which can be done through the update\-R\-H\-S() method. \-If the user requires the total constraints matrix, the latter can be queried through the method get\-Constraints\-Matrix\-A(), for speed concerns, the user needs to pass a matrix to this method already allocated. \-This can be done by querying the resulting total number of constraints through get\-Total\-Number\-Of\-Constraints() to resize the rows of your output matrix, while the columns will correspond to (size of input vector times the size of the preview window). \-After this, the user is left with updating the \-R\-H\-S of the inequalities to be queried also through \begin{DoxyWarning}{\-Warning}
\-Currently this class is only taking into account all the shape and admissibility constraints used in \-Ibanes 2016 thesis, thus missing any walking constraints.
