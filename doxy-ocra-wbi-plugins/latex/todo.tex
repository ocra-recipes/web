\-Class \hyperlink{classThread}{\-Thread} ]\-Remove task sequences. \-This class sets up an ocra\-::\-Model which is constructed from an \-Ocra\-Wbi\-Model and an ocra\-::\-Controller which can be specified as either a \-Wocra\-Controller, a \-Gocra\-Controller, or a \-Hocra\-Controller. \-The thread is looped at the period specified by the user (defaults to 10ms) and on each loop the \-Model is updated and the control torques are recalculated. $\ast$\-At the writing of this comment, task sequences are still in use and they too are initialized and updated here. \-They will be removed eventually.$\ast$
